I am currently a lecture from School of Transportation and Civil Engineering, Nantong University. I obtained my PhD from School of Computing in 2022, Dublin City University (funded by ADAPT Centre), and I was co-supervised by [Qun Liu](https://liuquncn.github.io/index_en.html), [Yvette Graham](https://www.tcd.ie/scss/people/academic-staff/ygraham/), and [Gareth Jones](https://www.dcu.ie/computing/people/gareth-jones). My research interests focus on Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Multi-modal Feature Fusion, Intelligent Transportation Systems and Multidisciplinary Applications of AI.
