# <font style="color: #87CEEB">Brief Biography</font>

I am currently a lecturer from School of Transportation and Civil Engineering, Nantong University. In 2022, I obtained my PhD in Computer Science (Natural Language Processing) at [Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/) (funded by [ADAPT Centre](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/)), and I was co-supervised by [Qun Liu](https://liuquncn.github.io/index_en.html), [Yvette Graham](https://www.tcd.ie/scss/people/academic-staff/ygraham/), and [Gareth Jones](https://www.dcu.ie/computing/people/gareth-jones). My research interests mainly focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), including the Evaluation of NLP, Large (Vision-)Language Models, and Visual Question Answering. Recently, I have extended my research to Multidisciplinary Applications of AI, such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Transport Emission Prediction, and LLMs for Transportation.
