Brief Biography
======

I am currently a lecturer from School of Transportation and Civil Engineering, Nantong University. In 2022, I obtained my PhD at Dublin City University (funded by ADAPT Centre), and I was co-supervised by [Qun Liu](https://liuquncn.github.io/index_en.html), [Yvette Graham](https://www.tcd.ie/scss/people/academic-staff/ygraham/), and [Gareth Jones](https://www.dcu.ie/computing/people/gareth-jones). My research interests focus on Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Multi-modal Feature Fusion, Intelligent Transportation Systems and Multidisciplinary Applications of AI.
